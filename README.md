#### The successor to the now deceased tunes.ninja

## Structure

I need to actually eventually write how this repo is structured but important notes

- [@songsync/discord](https://github.com/jacc/SongSync/tree/main/apps/discord): where all of the discord code is written
- [@streamticker/cache](https://github.com/jacc/SongSync/tree/main/packages/cache): wonderful Redis caching package taken from [StreamTicker](https://github.com/streamticker)
